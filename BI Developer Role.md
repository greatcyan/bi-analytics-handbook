### Minimum of 3 years of experience in BI development:
I have over a year and a half of practical experience as a DX Business Analyst-Finance/Power BI Developer, where I’ve been extensively involved in BI development. In this role, I’ve handled ETL processes and data modeling within Power BI, including data transformation, merging or appending tables, staging, and establishing relationships in data models. My previous experience as a Python Developer gave me a solid foundation in coding, data analysis, and visualization, which has been instrumental in my BI work. Additionally, my training in SQL and data modeling has further bolstered my BI development skills. Although I haven’t reached the 3-year mark yet, my combined experience and training have provided me with a robust background in BI development.

### Proficiency with Azure data warehouse technologies and services
While I don’t have direct experience with Azure data warehouse technologies, I have a strong background in related areas. In my current role as a DX Business Analyst-Finance/Power BI Developer, I’ve been involved in data modeling and ETL processes using Power BI, which has given me a solid understanding of data management and warehousing principles. My experience with SQL and data modeling is directly applicable to working with data warehouses. Additionally, I am keen to expand my skills to include Azure data warehouse technologies and am actively seeking resources and training to gain proficiency in this area. My ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies has been demonstrated in my previous roles, and I am confident that I can apply this same approach to Azure.

### Strong knowledge of data modeling, SQL, and data warehousing standards.
I have practical experience with SQL queries using both Microsoft SQL Server and Google BigQuery. In my current role, I frequently write SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data, ensuring that it is accurately represented in our reports and dashboards.

Regarding data modeling, I have extensively worked with Power BI, where I apply data modeling best practices with a focus on creating star schemas. This approach has helped me design efficient and scalable data models that support complex analytical queries and provide clear insights. By aiming for a star schema, I ensure that our data is organized in a way that supports efficient querying and reporting, adhering to data warehousing standards.
