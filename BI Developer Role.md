I have over a year and a half of practical experience as a DX Business Analyst-Finance/Power BI Developer, where I’ve been extensively involved in BI development. In this role, I’ve handled ETL processes and data modeling within Power BI, including data transformation, merging or appending tables, staging, and establishing relationships in data models. My previous experience as a Python Developer gave me a solid foundation in coding, data analysis, and visualization, which has been instrumental in my BI work. Additionally, my training in SQL and data modeling has further bolstered my BI development skills. Although I haven’t reached the 3-year mark yet, my combined experience and training have provided me with a robust background in BI development.
