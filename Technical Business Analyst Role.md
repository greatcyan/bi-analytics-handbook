Hi Matt Miller, good afternoon. My name is Cyrus. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology, majoring in Electronics, and I have a strong understanding of IoT devices.

I am a career shifter. I spent a decade in semiconductor test engineering and board repair before transitioning to data analytics, where I have been for over a year and a half. In this role, I have been extensively involved in empowering businesses to make informed decisions through data-driven insights.

I have handled ETL processes, data modeling, and designed interactive and intuitive reports and dashboards.

Additionally, I have experience as a Python Developer, which provided me with a strong foundation in coding and programming, instrumental in my BI projects.

My proficiency in Power BI, Tableau, programming languages including Python, R, SQL, and automation tools such as Power Automate and Power Apps has further enhanced my skills relevant to data analytics.

My previous role as a test technician and board repair specialist gave me a background in statistical analysis, particularly process capability index (CpK). This analysis ensured that the circuit boards and electronic components we refurbished were reliable and not prone to warranty issues. Additionally, I am currently undergoing training for a data science certification program, which has familiarized me with other statistical methods and the data transformation and preparation processes used for machine learning.

Although I do not have direct experience working with Snowflake as mentioned in the key requirements, I do have experience with related areas such as SAP Business Objects, SAP Business Warehouse, Google BigQuery, and Microsoft SQL Server, which I accumulated through previous training and certifications, self learning and in my current role.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, which are essential as mentioned in the key requirements. Regarding my communication skills, although English is not my primary language, I always strive to ensure my message is understood by my stakeholders and continuously seek opportunities to improve.

I think that's all. Thank you for this opportunity to be interviewed for the Data Analyst position.
