# BI & Analytics Handbook

Welcome to my personal knowledge base for **Business Intelligence and Analytics Engineering**. This repository serves as a centralized hub for data modeling patterns and technical best practices.

## 🧠 Core Data Modeling Principles

One of the foundational pillars of this repository is mastering the **Star Schema**. Below is a quick reference guide based on standard BI interview and architectural patterns.

| Topic | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| **How do you design a star schema?** | A star schema consists of a central **fact table** with measurable data and foreign keys, surrounded by **dimension tables** that store descriptive attributes. This structure improves query performance, simplifies DAX, and makes the model easier for users to understand. |
| **Why prefer star schema over snowflake?** | I generally prefer a star schema because it is simpler, more intuitive, and performs better in Power BI. |
